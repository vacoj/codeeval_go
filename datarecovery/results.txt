At the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s 
An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalkul, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945 
The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961 
The second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by Brooker in 1954 and was called the "Mark 1 Autocode" 
The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language 
It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during  period from 1955 until 1959 
However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making  process much slower than running the equivalent machine code 
Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form

The first programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the 1950s

However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000 
The language Fortran was developed at IBM in the mid '50s, and became the first widely used high-level general purpose programming language 
Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendent AIMACO were in actual use at the time

Another early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC
